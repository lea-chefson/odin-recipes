            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>From northern Thailand, a noodle soup with an amazing mix of flavor and texture. My mom made this for me
                recently, and I fell in love with it. It is a variation on a recipe about street food she found in her
                local
                paper. It is quite flavorful, so if you prefer a less spicy dish, reduce the amount of spices.</p>

    <h2>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chopped shallots and
                garlic
                until garlic starts to turn golden, 2 to 4 minutes. Add red curry paste and curry powder; cook and stir
                until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add coconut milk, water, chicken, and sea salt; bring to a boil. Reduce
                heat
                to medium low and simmer soup. </li>
            <li>Mix fish sauce, sugar, and lime juice into soup and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 cup oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; fry Thai chile peppers until browned, 2 to 4
                minutes.
                Transfer chile peppers to soup, reserving oil in skillet. Fry quartered shallots and bok choy in hot oil
                until browned, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to soup and reserve oil in skillet.</li>
            <li>Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15
                minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Add 3/4 of the noodles to the soup. Fry the remaining rice noodles
                in
                the hot oil until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide soup among 6 bowls and top with fried noodles, pickled cabbage, cilantro, and lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
